      <h3>What is Fortnite?</h3>
      <p>
        Fortnite is an online multiplayer game developed by Epic Games, first released in 2017. Known for its colorful visuals, dynamic building mechanics, and constantly evolving content, it has become one of the most influential games in history. Players can build, shoot, and survive solo or with friends in a variety of modes.

      <h3>Game Modes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Battle Royale:</strong> 100 players drop onto an island and fight to be the last one standing. The storm shrinks the map, making encounters inevitable.</li>
        <li><strong>Creative Mode:</strong> Build your own worlds and mini-games using Fortnite assets. A sandbox mode for creators and explorers.</li>
        <li><strong>Zero Build:</strong> A newer mode that removes the building mechanics for pure shooting and survival gameplay.</li>
        <li><strong>Save the World:</strong> Fortnite's original co-op PvE mode where players team up to battle AI zombie-like enemies (available separately).</li>
      </ul>
